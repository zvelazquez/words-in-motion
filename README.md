# project overview
For me, when I think about community, I think of it as the  result of cultivated relationships, individuals that you choose to spend your time and energy with, something that remains constant and present throughout your life even as changes are happening around you in a life where nothing is permanent.

The lyrics to the song "The Beach II" by Wolf Alice reflect this feeling of community and friendship for me. The imagery created from the lyrics imagines a day spent on the beach, basking in the sun laughing and having fun with your friends. The calming, euphoric atmosphere and warmth of the sun reflects that feeling of inner peace and tranquility that I associate by spending time with those that I love and value most. 

To capture and share my idea of community, I created an interactive website. Additionally, throughout this personal project I was able to build up and expand my skills in CSS animations. 

# technical overview
CURRENT STATUS = 98% Completed

To create this site, I used the Visual Studio Code application to code my HTML and CSS. 

The site is structure using a large amount of different folders, one corresponding to each page. Each folder contains an HTML file for that corresponding page that links to the proceeding page so that the viewer navigates chronologically through the site in the simpliest format.

There is ONE CSS file for the whole site, which is linked to each HTML page. There are comment lines on the CSS page seperating the CSS code for different pages on the site. The CSS code at the top of the file is used on multiple, if not all pages. 

Extra additions include an IMG (image) and JS (javascript) folder. No images were used on the site so the folder is empty. Javascript was used by being incorporated inline the HTML, but no additional script files were used.
