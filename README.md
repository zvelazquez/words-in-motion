# project overview
For me, when I think about community, I think of it as the  result of cultivated relationships, individuals that you choose to spend your time and energy with, something that remains constant and present throughout your life even as changes are happening around you in a life where nothing is permanent.

The lyrics to the song "The Beach II" by Wolf Alice reflect this feeling of community and friendship for me. The imagery created from the lyrics imagines a day spent on the beach, basking in the sun laughing and having fun with your friends. The calming, euphoric atmosphere and warmth of the sun reflects that feeling of inner peace and tranquility that I associate by spending time with those that I love and value most. 

To capture and share my idea of community, I created an interactive website. Additionally, throughout this personal project I was able to build up and expand my skills in CSS animations
