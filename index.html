            Skimming stones, I don't care what floats<br>
            When I look out beyond the water<br>
            The waves lick our feet, our hands meet<br>
            Mother Nature's daughtеrs<br>
            And the sun goes down, as it must come up<br>
            Consistеnt like the laughter<br>
            Of the girls on the beach, my girls on the beach<br>
            Happy ever after<br>
            Okay (It's okay)<br>
            Girls on the beach
            My girls on the beach<br>
            Okay<br>
            Girls on the beach, my...<br>
            Happy ever after
